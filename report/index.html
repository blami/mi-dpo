<h1>ATM - Design Patterns Demo Application</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This application is very simplifed program model of an automated teller
    machine (ATM) implemented in Java using various design patterns to
    demonstrate their benefit and my understanding to these benefits.
    </p>
<p>
    ATM (also known as automated banking machine, ABM) is an networked embedded
    computer device that provides basic financial transactions to the clients of
    banking institution. Application emulates very simple ATM that allows client
    identified by PIN (personal identification number) to check balance and
    to withdraw or deposit money with optional overdraft.
    </p>
<p>
    Note: PINs for testing are: 1234 or 4321.

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            Real world ATM is a very complex system built from many
            subsystems. My program model is way simpler but still there are
            subsystems interacting together using simple interfaces.
            Encapsulating larger bodies of code of these subsystems is what is
            facade design pattern for. In ATM application I use facade pattern
            twice as follows.
            </p>
<p>
            First case is encapsulation of entire model into <span class="code">ATM</span>
            facade containing <span class="code">BankService</span>, <span class="code">UI</span> and
            <span class="code">Process</span> subsystems. <span class="code">ATM</span> is top-most level class
            with <span class="code">run()</span> method fired by main class.
            </p>
<p>
            Second case is <span class="code">UI</span> subsystem facade containing various
            widgets (currently keyboard and screen). Entire UI is communicating
            with "outer" world only by <span class="code">read()</span> and <span class="code">write()</span>
            methods, because that is all the other subsystem should use as shown in code
            below.
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h5>Usage Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
    ui.write("Hello! Insert number:");
    int pin = ui.read();
        </code></pre>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of Facade</h3>
<p>
            Implementation of my facade is in both cases typical. There are
            private fields for objects representing facade subsystems. These
            objects are instantiated from the facade constructor.
            </p>
<p>
            UI facade constructor takes an additional <span class="code">UIFactory</span>
            argument to specify which concrete factory will be used to
            instantiate UI widgets. See abstract factory pattern below.
            </p>
<h4>UML diagramy</h4>
<h4>Codes with Implementation</h4>
<h5>Implementation Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
public class ATM {
    private UI ui = null;
    private BankService bank = null;
    private Process process = null; 

    /**
     * Constructs ATM using configuration read from application-wide registry.
     */
    public ATM() {
        // construct UI
        ui = ...

        // construct BankService
        bank = ...

        // construct Process
        process = ...
    }

    /**
     * ATM lifecycle method.
     */
    public void run() {
        ui.initialize();

        // do work
        while(...) {
            process.script();
        }
    }
}
        </code></pre>

</ul>
<h3>Advantages of Facade</h3>
<p>
            Primary advantage of facade design pattern is improved readability
            and logical encapsulation of code. Business logic does not need to
            know internal architecture of subsystem. Methods needed to
            interface with subsystem will suffice.
            </p>
<p>
            Another benefit of facade is that subsystems and their wiring under
            the hood can be absolutely changed. This can be used for rapid
            prototyping of non-critical systems and later refactoring (this
            assume well-designed facade interface).

<div class="pattern">
<a name="2"></a><h2>Singleton</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            Singleton design pattern restricts class instantiation to exactly one
            object and provides static method to obtain reference to this 
            instance. This is perfect when we need easily accessible object holding
            global information.
            </p>
<p>
            I made main class <span class="code">Application</span> singleton holding
            application-wide registry. Each object in ATM can easily get
            instance of <span class="code">Application</span> class and read or write
            <span class="code">key:value</span> pairs into registry like in following code listing.
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h5>Usage Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
Application app = Application.getInstance();
Object config = app.getValue("config");
        </code></pre>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of Singleton</h3>
<p>
            Application class is a typical singleton with private constructor and
            static method <span class="code">getInstance()</span> returning same instance
            (initialized amidst first access and stored in private field
            <span class="code">instance</span>).
            </p>
<p>
            Singleton is not synchronized and blocks <span class="code">clone()</span> by
            throwing <span class="code">CloneNotSupportedException</span>.
            </p>

<h4>Codes with Implementation</h4>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is implemented</h4>
<ul><li><a href="src/cz/cvut/fit/dpo/Application.java">Application.java</a></li></ul>
<h3>Advantages of Singleton</h3>
<p>
            Advantage of singleton over static methods is that singleton is full
            fledged object that supports inheritance. In this case we can easily
            move to persistent registry by overloading <span class="code">setValue()</span> and
            <span class="code">getValue</span> methods in inherited class. If launching mechanism
            of <span class="code">ATM</span> facade changes in future, we don't need fix two source
            files as in static methods case.

<a name="3"></a><h2>Abstract Factory</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            In real world ATM maker distributes ATMs to many banks. Every
            bank has different brand, uses different size of screen or shape
            of keys. But all screens and keyboards behave same, they only look
            different. To make my ATM use different user interfaces while using
            same behavior and business logic I use abstract factory design pattern.
            Code snippet bellow shows UI widgets initialization (<span class="code">UIScreen</span>,
            <span class="code">UIKeyboard</span> and <span class="code">UIFactory</span> are interfaces).
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h5>Usage Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
public class UI {
    private UIScreen screen;    
    private UIKeyboard keyboard;
    
    /**
     * Construct UI using given UIFactory.
     * @param factory   concrete UIFactory 
     */
    public UI(UIFactory factory) {
        screen = factory.createScreen();
        keyboard = factory.createKeyboard();
    }

    ...
        </code></pre>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of Abstract Factory</h3>
<p>
            My implementation of abstract factory works
            as follows. Both console and Swing user interfaces are unified by
            the <span class="code">UIFactory</span> interface (code example #1). They produce same sets of
            widget products that are also implementing the same base interfaces
            <span class="code">UIKeyboard</span> (code example #2) and <span class="code">UIScreen</span>.
            </p>
<p>
            Concrete factory that will be used depends on command line
            argument. To start application using <span class="code">SwingUIFactory</span> use
            <span class="code">swing</span> argument. For <span class="code">ConsoleUIFactory</span> use
            <span class="code">console</span> argument instead.
            </p>

     */
    public int read();

<h3>Advantages of Abstract Factory</h3>
<p>
            Main advantage of a bit more complex abstract factory design
            pattern is an easy interchangeability of whole sets of products which
            is typical user interface issue.

<a name="4"></a><h2>State</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            When client uses ATM, he/she goes through many states of ATM process
            diagram (e.g. entering pin, navigating in menu, withdrawing money).
            I simplified this process down to four states and implemented it using
            state design pattern.
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h5>Usage Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
process.setState(new LoginState());
process.script();
        </code></pre>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of State</h3>
<p>
            State pattern implementation in ATM is divided to <span class="code">Process</span>
            class that does state switching and execution of current state.
            States are classes (<span class="code">LoginState</span>, <span class="code">MenuState</span>,
            <span class="code">OperationState</span> and <span class="code">LogoutState</span>) implementing
            <span class="code">ProcessState</span> interface. Each state has <span class="code">script()</span>
            method that manipulates screen and keyborad in order to determine
            next state. Snippet of code bellow shows typical <span class="code">script()</span>
            body taken from <span class="code">LoginState</span> class.
            </p>
<h4>UML diagramy</h4>
<h5>Class diagram</h5>
<img src="state.png" alt="" title=""><h4>Codes with Implementation</h4>
<h5>Implementation Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
UI ui = context.getUI();
BankService bank = context.getBankService();

int pin;

// display PIN request
ui.write("Wellcome in " + bank.getName() + "\n\n"
    + "ENTER PIN:");
pin = ui.read();

// verify PIN
if(bank.authorize(pin)) {
    context.setState(new MenuState(pin));
} else { 
    context.setState(new LogoutState("ERROR: Invalid PIN!"));
}
        </code></pre>

</ul>
<h3>Advantages of State</h3>
<p>
            State design pattern makes process-scenario code readable and
            organized. It is very easy extend process with new states. Combined
            with additional patterns like abstract factory (see above) could be made
            fully interchangeable.

<a name="5"></a><h2>Strategy</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            Nowadays, ATMs are very smart devices. They don't offer only
            money withdrawal but also can send money to another account,
            pay bills or pre-pay your cell phone. What have all these
            operations in common? You're always spending your money. I simplified
            situation for my model. There are only two operations - withdraw and 
            deposit money. They are both handled as two interchangeable algorithms 
            in strategy design pattern.
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h5>Usage Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
        operation.setStrategy(new DepositStrategy());
        operation.execute(...);
        </code></pre>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of Strategy</h3>
<p>
            When user enters menu choices for withdraw or deposit money,
            <span class="code">Operation</span> object is configured with proper strategy object
            (<span class="code">WithdrawStrategy</span> or <span class="code">DepositStrategy</span>) and given
            to <span class="code">OperationState</span> which handles both operations in one
            state (see above).
            </p>
<p>
            Different strategies are objects that implement
            <span class="code">OperationStrategy</span> interface containing important
            <span class="code">execute()</span> method and few helper methods for
            <span class="code">OperationState</span> (e.g. method returning title
            shown on ATM's screen when using this strategy).
            </p>

</ul>
<h3>Advantages of Strategy</h3>
<p>
            Indetifying operations having same goal that can be reached
            in different ways and using strategy pattern to implement them makes
            resulting code more modular and configurable runtime.
            </p>
<p>
            My use of strategy pattern is bumpy because I simplified use case
            too much. To enlight, my idea was that withdraw and deposit are
            same thing with different sign.

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            In real world ATM, when you input something using keyboard most
            likely you see your input on screen. In ATM application this was
            very easy with console user interface (most terminal emulators
            will handle this). When I added Swing interface this was serious
            issue. Both keyboard and screen are independent objects driven
            by <span class="code">UI</span> facade, not knowing each other. To adhere with
            clean abstract factory interface I needed to solve this issue at
            SwingUI level so I've used observer pattern to subscribe observers
            of keyboard widget which notifies them every time when key is 
            pressed. Subscription is made by <span class="code">SwingUIFactory</span>.
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of Observer</h3>
<p>
            <span class="code">SwingUIKeyboard</span> acts as subject providing interface to
            subscribe and unsubscribe to. Every time is on keyboard pressed
            button, all subscribers are notified by invoking their
            <span class="code">poke()</span> method with complete input buffer given as
            argument. This method is only method defined by
            <span class="code">SwingUIKeyboardObserver</span> interface that must be implemented
            by every object that wants to receive notifications.
            </p>

<h3>Advantages of Observer</h3>

            Using observer design pattern I was able to keep light interface of
            UI and solve described issue in proper place without hacking into
            other than SwingUI components.

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
            Behind every ATM is a bank providing remote service to authenticate
            user, check balance or authorize withdraw. When bank introduces new
            product it should be integrated to this remote service in a way
            that does not break ATM software asking original service without
            this product. In my model I used decorator design pattern to
            decorate basic account with overdraft option.
            </p>
<p>
            To run program with overdraft decorator add <span class="code">overdraft</span>
            argument to command line.
            </p>
<h4>Codes with usage</h4>
<h5>Usage Example #1</h5>
<pre><code>
// construct BankService
bank = new Bank();
// check if overdraft should be available
if(...){
    bank = new BankOverdraftDecorator(bank);
}
        </code></pre>
<h4>Links to the Source code, where the pattern is used</h4>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Implementation of Decorator</h3>
<p>
            Both simple <span class="code">Bank</span> and <span class="code">BankOverdraftDecorator</span>
            implement <span class="code">BankService</span> interface representing remote
            service discussed above. <span class="code">BankOverdraftDecorator</span> is
            inherited from <span class="code">BankAbstractDecorator</span> which is a basic
            skeleton for decorator able to swallow object implementing
            <span class="code">BankService</span>. Despite the fact that this skeleton class is
            abstract, all methods are implemented as passthrough (asi illustrated on code example bellow) to swallowed
            object so descendant concrete decorator only needs to overload
            methods that affects.

<h3>Advantages of Decorator</h3>
<p>
            Decorator pattern allows to add new features to simple objects while
            keeping their original interface. For the sake of keeping same interface
            decorators can be pilled infinitely. Thanks to decorator I was able to
            create extended service based on original <span class="code">Bank</span> without 
            changes in business logic.

<h2>Conclussion</h2>
<p>
        I found out that the use of design patterns may look like overhead but
        it may be healthy even in small projects. Use of design patterns may
        split one simple class to three files but this change may save day or
        month of work when customer yields for new feature. It is important to
        have good sense in design phase. Many times I've used pattern A that
        was good for use with B but when I tried to implement them later with C
        my design failed.
        </p>

        Although lectures were very dissapointing and boring since the
        beginning (in my humble opinion they were cited parts from Erich
        Gamma's book which I've bought during semester so I died out) I liked
        MI-DPO seminars during semester. Mr. Kurs demonstrated almost every
        single design pattern on real world example which is best way to
        understand for me. He was also very helpfull and open to argue.
        </p>
<p>
        Thing I hate about MI-DPO most is this project. For someone who doesn't
        use design patterns every day is very difficult to see six of them in
        detail working together so I started again and again (yes I know I can
        commit more smaller demos using less patterns, but use them in one
        application was more challenging). That's reason why I'm commiting that
        late. It would be way better to have prepared scenarios to use 2-3
        patterns to solve some situation or better to refactor existing code
        using design patterns. Or at least to give to students mock ideas to
        implement using design patterns.
